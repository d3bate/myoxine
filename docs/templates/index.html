        <h2>GraphQL is a query langauge designed to retrieve data from APIs.
            You ask only for what you want and get only what you need.</h2>

        <h2>Myoxine ensures that you only ask for what you don't already have.
            When you get something, Myoxine updates your application to reflect it.</h2>

        <h2>Myoxine is an experimental project developed by d3bate. It's being developed
            in parallel with a new project of ours. It's top-secret for now, but the
            intention is to build a new way for people to experience literature. We don't
            just want to change things, however. We want to make things better. When it
            launches, this platform will become a not-for-profit with a mission to open
            access to literature to everyone.</h2>

        <h2>Myoxine wants to empower people to build reliable, dependable and efficient web
        applications which are easy to use. And of course, we want you to use these applications
            to do good for all in world. We kindly ask that you refrain from using our work to
            do evil things.</h2>

            future of web applications to be a future where web applications actually work.</h2>
