# Myoxine

Myoxine is a (planned) blazing-fast GraphQL runtime to design web applications which run using Rust
compiled to WebAssembly. Myoxine relies on Yew, a framework for building web applications in Rust 
analagous to React, Vue or Angular, to display content to end users. It leverages Rust's macro 
system to provide interfaces to GraphQL specifications in a way which feels natural and intuitive.

Fair warning, however – Myoxine is very experimental, so any use is at your peril (the license means
that usage will always be at your peril, but at this stage it's especially new so as a result usage
is particularly likely to result in your peril).

> Myoxine is distributed subject to the Mozilla Public License 2.0. Any use of this code
> may only be in compliance with the license.

We additionally ask that you use this software only for positive effect to improve people's lives.
We do not mandate this – it is merely a request.
